*An asterisk preceding an estimate indicates change is statistically different from zero at the 90 percent confidence level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Z Represents or rounds to zero.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"2A margin of error is a measure of an estimate's variability.  The larger the margin of error in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate.  This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval.  Margin of errors shown in this table are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights.  For more information, see ""Standard Errors and Their Use"" at <www2.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266sa.pdf>.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"4A primary family is a group of two or more people, one of whom is the householder, related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. All such people (including related subfamily members) are considered as members of one family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
